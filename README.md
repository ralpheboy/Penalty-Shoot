A soccer penalty shootout simulator, built with _HTML_, _CSS_ and _JavaScript_.

## Rules

The user takes a shot at the click of a button, with a desired direction from the select input. After the user does so, the computer acts as a goalkeeper, making a save in a random direction, in an attempt to match the user's shot direction. In the case of the user getting a good shot, a certain audio file is played, and in the case of the computer saving the shot, a different audio file is played. The first to three goals wins the game.
