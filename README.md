A soccer penalty shootout simulator, built with _HTML_, _CSS_ and _JavaScript_.

## Rules

The user takes a shot at the click of a button, with a desired direction from the select input. After the user does so, the computer acts as a goalkeeper, making a save in a random direction, in an attempt to match the user's shot direction. In the case of the user getting a good shot, a certain audio file is played, and in the case of the computer saving the shot, a different audio file is played. The first to three goals wins the game.

   A div with a football net for a background image. This container is divided into three parts; the left, center and the right parts. Certain changes are made to these parts based on the user's goal area selection, and the computer's choice.

3. Button and Input Elements

   These inputs and button elements are used to control the game. The select element allows the user choose what area of the goal post he or she will place a shot. The shoot button simply activates the flow of the game, and the reset button takes everything to a default state.
